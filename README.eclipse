To import the project (for the first time) in Eclipse from github:
File->Import...Git -> Projects from Git (with smart import) ... clone URL
   (paste from the github repository) (more steps) at some point, tell 
   about where to import to: in your workspace
   
To pull (check out a brand new version from git) in Eclipse: 
right click on the project -> Team -> pull

To push (check in to git changes you've made locally) in Eclipse:
right click on the project -> Team -> push branch 'xx'  (master in my case)
