 1. Install Git (if not already)
 
 	https://git-scm.com/download/
 	
 	Run through the installer, all the defaults are fine (even the default editor).
 	
 2. Configure Git bash or Github desktop

 	If you kept the defaults during Git install then you have Git Bash.
 		Use that if you know how or can figure it out with online guides.
 		
 	ELSE skip bash and continue with Github desktop.
 	
 	https://desktop.github.com/
 	
 3. With Github desktop open:
 
 	Go to File -> Options -> Accounts : 
 		Sign in to Github
 	
 	Then from Options -> Git :
 	
 		My name there is the same as my username in Github.
 		Use the same email used for your Github. 
 		
4. Clone the repository

	File -> Clone Repository
		The Github.com tab should be open by default and display all repo's you own or are a collaborator of. 
		
		Select andyfelt/MyMovieWatchlist
		
		Find where to clone to:
			Choose button -> Find the folder where your Eclipse projects are located and select it
			
		Click Clone button
		
5. Eclipse:

	File -> Open projects from file system -> Directory :
		File folder MyMovieWatchlist & select it
		
	Make sure the folder is selected/checked
	
	Click finish.
	
6. Pull/Push

	Make changes in Eclipse as normal.
	
	Open Github desktop:
		If this is your only repo then MyMoviewatchlist should be selected and the branch master.
		
		Repository -> Pull :
			Gets new stuff, this is how the typer will start each day and any time when need to get changes.
			Always pull before pushing.
			
		Repository -> Push :
			Pushes up your changes. 
			
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't know what a conflict looks like so we will figure that out if we reach that bridge 
	but only one person should be pushing at a time (the typer).
You can use Gitbash instead of Github desktop and/or a different IDE/editor but my help will be limited 
	(worth a shot though).
Hope this helps, it's all I got.
